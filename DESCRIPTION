Title: Explore the Spanish INE Data using this Geographic Tool
Version: 0.1
Description: A tool that assists the user in two tasks: the map reading process and the
  data representation process. The reading process is leveraged with functions that allow
  the user to find maps in the Siane repository easily, i.e. searching by map year or
  administrative level. The other main functionality is to bind numerical data to polygons.
  This package is only compatible with the spanish IGN(National Institute of Geography) maps
  and the INE(National Institute of Statistics) data.
